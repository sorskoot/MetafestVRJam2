# Planet Runner

Entry for Metafest VR Game Jam

## Goal

Run around the planet grabbing as many white orbs as possible. But beware! Every time you loop around the planet you have less time to do it again, and the levels become more complex every time.

## Gameplay

Run by swinging your hands like you are running. Jump by throwing your hands into the air. Step left and right or duck to avoid running into obstacles.

The game is build to run on VR device like the Oculus Quest and doesn't run on mobile or desktop.
